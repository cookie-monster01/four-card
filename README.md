## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- Semantic HTML
- Using BEM naming method.
- Centering content with Flexbox. 
- Aligning .card__img by applying CSS grid on .card
- Aligning cards using CSS Grid on larger screen sizes. 
- Scaling margins or paddings on different screen sizes using calc() instead of media-queries. 

### Continued development

- I couldn't adjust the icon size (.card__img) without using media-queries. I tried using width (89.07% ) and max-width (64px), and I also tried applying min-width (57px) with either width (100%) or max-width (64px). Can someone please help understand why it might not have worked and how could i solve this? 
- Could someone please explain why when I reduce the margin between two cards, the size of the cards reduces as well?
- Writing readable and robust code. 
- Flexbox and CSS Grid
- CSS properties
